Priority Recommendations
Based on your current setup, I'd recommend implementing these in order:

User profiles and basic statistics - Builds user engagement and retention
League chat/discussion features - Increases social interaction
Mobile PWA capabilities - Critical for user accessibility
Achievement/badge system - Low-cost gamification with high engagement impact
Advanced league formats (draft, salary cap) - Differentiates from competitors

Implementation Considerations
Some features require careful balance to avoid encouraging problematic gambling behaviors:

Implement spending limits and cooling-off periods
Provide clear information about odds and expected outcomes
Include responsible gaming resources and self-exclusion options
Consider age verification and geographic restrictions based on local regulations

The most valuable additions would be those that increase user retention and engagement while building a sustainable community around your platform. Focus on features that encourage users to return regularly and invite friends to join.
